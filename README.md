#### Description:

SPA for reading comics.<br>
SeeR uses Manga Scraper API that gives reach to two hosts (mangareader.net and mangafox.me).<br>
You can switch between the two, although mangareader.net seems much more stable than mangafox.me, so I'd suggest you use that one.<br>

Regarding local mode, you can choose files from your local machine and read those. Supported formats are *JPEG* and *PNG*.<br>
**Notice**: You'll need to put all the local files in one folder unfortunately, as current web APIs don't allow me to create whole folder tree with volumes and chapters.
