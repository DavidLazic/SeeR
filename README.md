## SeeR
Angular v1.4.0 | NodeJS SPA.

#### Description:

SPA for reading comics.<br>
SeeR uses Manga Scraper API that gives reach to two hosts (mangareader.net and mangafox.me).<br>
You can switch between the two, although mangareader.net seems much more stable than mangafox.me, so I'd suggest you use that one.<br>

Regarding local mode, you can choose files from your local machine and read those. Supported formats are *JPEG* and *PNG*.<br>
**Notice**: You'll need to put all the local files in one folder unfortunately, as current web APIs don't allow me to create whole folder tree with volumes and chapters.

I've created desktop version of the app (currently Windows platform only).<br>
